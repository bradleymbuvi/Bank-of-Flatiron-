# Bank-of-Flatiron-

Flatiron Bank Transactions Web App
This project is a React application designed to practice components, props, state management, event handling, and data fetching. It displays a list of recent bank transactions and offers features like adding, filtering, sorting, and deleting transactions.

Requirements
Implement a well-written README file.
Fetch data from a local server running JSON DB server.

Setup & Pre-requisite Data
Create a db.json file in your project directory.
Use this data for your server DB.
Run json-server --watch db.json to start the backend.
Test your server by visiting http://localhost:8001/transactions.

Setup
After unbundling the project:

Run npm install in your terminal.
Run npm run server. This will run your backend on port 8001.
In a new terminal, run npm start. This will run your React app on port 8000.
Make sure to open http://localhost:8001/transactions in the browser to verify that your backend is working before you proceed!


Project Setup
Create a new project folder.
Set up a private GitHub repository and add your TM as a contributor.
Regularly commit to the repository.


Core Deliverables
Display a table of all transactions.
Allow users to add new transactions to the table (not persisted to the backend).
Enable filtering transactions by description.


Bonus Deliverables
Allow sorting transactions alphabetically by category or description.
Implement deletion of transactions from the table.
